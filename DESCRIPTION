Description: This package implements a general version of the model described in Moran, Kelly R, et al. "Bayesian `Deep' Process Convolutions: An Application in Cosmology" (2024) https://arxiv.org/html/2411.14747v1. This model utilizes two-layers of process convolutions to model mean functions whose smoothness varies over the domain.
